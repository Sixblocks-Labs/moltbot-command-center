# 2026-01-31 — Backfill done

Created/updated docs so the Command Center Brain tab has content:
- journal/2026-01-29.md
- journal/2026-01-30.md (already existed)
- tasks/2026-01-30-moltbot-command-center-build-log.md (already existed)
- tasks/2026-01-29-31-chat-transcript.md
- notes/moltbot-command-center-spec.md

Next improvements (optional):
- A dedicated "Chat History" tab in the app that reads chat transcripts.
- Auto-write a daily journal + build log from gateway events.
